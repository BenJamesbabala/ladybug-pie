Description:
Python wrapper for Ladybug3 Spherical Camera API.

Only those that handle pre-existing *.pgr files have been wrapped. Methods for controlling the camera and recording video have not been wrapped. The software that comes with the camera is good enough for recording video.



TODO:
-Wrap remaining methods for use in real-time applications.
